	description = Originally developed by an overseas agency as a wind analysis satellite, we swapped a few sensors to make a small telescope. This telescope will not allow much science return, but it is useful as an easy way to increase the rate at which near-Kerbin asteroids are found.\nThis is the main part of the small telescope. Attach a service bay directly underneath this piece with necessary modules inside.
