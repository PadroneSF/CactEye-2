	RESULTS 
	{
			default = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. Its one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint. It is considered by some to be an almost sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures… Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are these people?

	RESULTS

	RESULTS

			default = Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. Its orbit is highly irregular and, together with its size, it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet. Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space. This dwarf planet was officially labeled as Not to be trusted by the scientific community.

	RESULTS 
	{
			default = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration. If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy.

After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon. Scientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall, and Jool overhead must be quite something.

	RESULTS

Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that telescopes don’t work that way. The intern was shortly afterwards promoted and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
